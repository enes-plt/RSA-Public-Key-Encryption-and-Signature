# RSA-Public-Key-Encryption-and-Signature
This RSA project includes the following tasks:

1.  Deriving Private Key: Compute the RSA private key using given primes and exponent.
2.  Message Encryption: Encrypt a given message using RSA with the public key.
3.  Message Decryption: Decrypt a provided ciphertext and convert it back to readable text.
4.  Digital Signature: Generate a digital signature for a message and observe signature differences with message changes.
5.  Signature Verification: Verify the authenticity of a signature using RSA public keys.
6.  X.509 Certificate Verification: Manually verify a real X.509 certificate by extracting and checking the issuer’s signature.

Each task emphasizes RSA’s cryptographic principles, supporting hands-on learning with encryption and secure message verification techniques.
